 - Classes vs Skills vs Weapons
    Class: Typical setup Wizard, Ranger, Fighter etc with set specific skills
    Skills: Everyone can learn all possible skills, but can only use so many at a time. Possible stat system included
    for balancing of skills
    Weapons: The weapon(s) you currently use determine your skills that you can utilize.

 - Enemy skills / items
    Enemy skills: have a way of studying enemy units to develop skills that you can use that you learned from the enemy
    such as suddenly you can use poison spray or new projectiles etc.
    Enemy items: Gather parts from enemies to create your own armor / weapons from the enemy.
        Full enemy armor set: Think Kaladin, if you have a full set of armor from a specific type of enemy it enrages
        them and they go berzerk and become stronger.

 - Upgradable town / main area.
    Zone: A safe zone for player that has all the merchants and such. Has an upgradable town that increases vendoes / items
    Possible 
    Building Upgrades: Skills / Items / Merchants
    Types of buildings: Farming? Farm for items to heal? Breed enemy units to create enemy items / skills?
